Actually, there is nothing really special about this category. The only difference from the "conventional" input types, is here the /secondary argument/ is different.

[section Joins]

[import ../example/v0/joins.cpp]

Joins aligns a sublist of arguments as if it where one argument. A join is created as pair of argumets between curling braces. The second of them is the list of arguments, which also has to be between curling braces:

* `{ `[~join_expession]`, {`[~arguments_sub_list]`} }`

where, the [~join_expression] is one of the following:

* `join_left(`[~width]`)`
* `join_left(`[~width]`, `[~fill_character]`)`
* `join_rigth(`[~width]`)`
* `join_rigth(`[~width]`, `[~fill_character]`)`
* `join_center(`[~width]`)`
* `join_center(`[~width]`, `[~fill_character]`)`
* `join_internal(`[~width]`, `[~num_args_before_fill]`)`
* `join_internal(`[~width]`, `[~fill_character]`, `[~num_args_before_fill]`)`

where:

* [~width] is `int`
* [~num_args_before_fill] is `int`
* [~fill_character] is `char32_t`

[h4 Example]

[joins_example]

You may want to use joins without the purpose of alignment, but solely to treat a whole sublist of arguments as one.
This is something you way need to do in case you are using an [link section_assembly_string assembly string], especially if you can not edit the assembly string.

[section ftuple]
[import ../example/v0/ftuple_as_input.cpp]

If you want to apply some facet objects to only a subset of the arguments,
you can use an [link ftuple ftuple] object as an input arg.
The syntax is similar to the [link joins join] syntax :

* `{ `[~ftuple_obj]` , { `[~arguments_sub_list] `} }`

[ftuple_input]

Note that the arguments in the sub list can be of any type that is possible in the outer list.
You can you, for instance, another ftuple:

[ftuple_input_2]

When using assembly string, be aware that the sublist of argument is treated as it where just one argument:

[ftuple_input_in_assembly_string]

[section Range ['(todo)]]
[import ../example/v0/range_input.cpp]

A /range/ is any container. The syntax is:

* `iterate(`[~range]`)`
* `iterate(`[~range], [~separator]`)`

[range_sample]

You can use the format functions to format the range's elements

[range_sample_2]

[endsect]

[section Assembly string ['(todo)]]
[import ../example/v0/assembly_string_input.cpp]

[note It is not decided yet wheter this will ever be implemented]

syntax:

* `{ assm(`[~assembly string]`) , { `[~arguments_sub_list]` } }`
